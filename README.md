# LearningJS
A repo for the Wes Bos 30 days of JavaScript course. Man do I owe this guy a coffee, or 10. I am so greatful for this free material! Have a look for yourself at the source code as I know it can be of use to anyone. If you have not already heard of Wes Bos, check out his 30 days of JS at WesBos.com
